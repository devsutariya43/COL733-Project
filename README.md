## **Project Proposal:** 

## **Benchmarking Redis Cluster vs Apache Ignite**

### **1. Systems Selected: Redis and Apache Ignite**

For this benchmarking study, we have selected Redis Cluster and Apache Ignite, two prominent in-memory key-value stores. Redis and Apache Ignite are used for low-latency, high-throughput applications but have different designs, architectures, and features.

In-memory data grids and caches like **Redis Cluster** and **Apache Ignite** are crucial for handling fast access to data in real-time applications such as web applications, recommendation engines, and high-frequency trading platforms. This project will benchmark Redis Cluster and Apache Ignite, focussing on their performance in data caching, in-memory computing, scalability, and fault tolerance under various workloads.

- **Redis Cluster** is a distributed version of Redis, a high-speed, in-memory key-value store. It excels in simplicity, low latency reads/writes, and scalability with automatic partitioning (sharding).

- **Apache Ignite** is an in-memory computing platform that provides both an in-memory data grid and support for distributed computing. It offers more complex operations (SQL, distributed joins, and compute) in addition to primary key-value storage.


### **2. Expected Differences and Real-World Importance**

We anticipate several performance, consistency, and scalability differences between Redis Cluster and Apache Ignite:

- **Performance (Latency and Throughput):** Redis Cluster is renowned for its low-latency data access and high throughput, especially for simple key-value operations. However, scaling across nodes may introduce overhead as Redis is optimized for single-threaded performance. Apache Ignite, designed for distributed computing, is expected to offer better throughput and performance in transactional workloads and distributed computations. However, it may have higher latencies due to its more complex architecture and support for ACID transactions.

* **Consistency vs Availability:** Redis Cluster follows an **eventual consistency** model under certain failure conditions, leading to potential stale reads. Redis prioritizes availability (AP in the CAP theorem) during failures by continuing operations even if some nodes are unavailable. Apache Ignite, in contrast, offers **strong consistency** with ACID guarantees, making it more suitable for scenarios where data correctness is crucial, such as financial systems or inventory management. However, this may come at the cost of higher latency.

* **Scalability and Fault Tolerance:** Redis Cluster offers horizontal scalability by sharding data across nodes, with automatic failover and recovery via **Redis Sentinel.** However, data replication is partial, and certain failures can lead to loss of availability for a subset of data shards. Apache Ignite has built-in replication and fault-tolerance mechanisms with full replication options. Its distributed computing framework also allows it to handle complex queries and transactions across a large number of nodes efficiently.

Understanding these differences is crucial for real-world applications, where trade-offs between performance, data consistency, and fault tolerance are often required.


### **3. Benchmarks to be Run and Their Impact**

We plan to design and execute the following benchmarks to evaluate Redis Cluster and Apache Ignite across multiple dimensions:

**Latency and Throughput:**

- **Scenario:** Measure read and write latencies across single-node and multi-node configurations.

- **Test:** Simulate varying workloads (read-heavy, write-heavy, and mixed) to measure latency and throughput across different data sizes and concurrency levels.

- **Impact:** This will demonstrate which system performs better under typical caching and data scenarios.

**Scalability:**

- **Scenario:** Benchmark system performance as more nodes are added to the cluster.

- **Test:** Measures how Redis Cluster and Apache Ignite handle the load as the number of nodes increases. Observe the impact on data distribution and the ability to manage large datasets.

- **Impact:** This will highlight the trade-offs between scaling overhead and data partitioning efficiency for both systems.

**Consistency vs Availability (CAP Trade-Offs):**

- **Scenario:** Test both systems under failure conditions like network partitions or node failures.

- **Test:** Introduce network splits or take down nodes and evaluate how Redis Cluster (with eventual consistency) and Apache Ignite (with ACID transactions) behave regarding data accuracy and availability.

- **Impact:** This will illustrate which system is more suitable for use cases where consistency or availability is a priority.

**Memory Usage and Persistence:**

- **Scenario:** Test how Redis Cluster and Apache Ignite handle memory-intensive workloads.

- **Test:** Push both systems toward memory limits and measure performance degradation. For Redis Cluster, test-optional persistence with RDB and AOF, and compare it with Ignite’s hybrid memory and disk architecture.

- **Impact:** This will evaluate how efficiently each system manages in-memory data and persists data to disk under high-memory scenarios.

**Fault Tolerance and Recovery:**

- **Scenario:** Simulate node failures and measure recovery performance.

- **Test:** Compare how Redis Cluster’s fault tolerance (via Redis Sentinel) handles failovers, vs. Ignite’s replication and recovery mechanisms. Measure recovery times and data integrity after a node failure.

- **Impact:** This will show which system offers better fault tolerance and faster recovery, making it more reliable for distributed environments.


### **4. Conclusion**

This benchmarking study will offer insights into the strengths and weaknesses of Redis Cluster and Apache Ignite in different scenarios, helping practitioners choose the right system for their specific use cases, whether focused on high-performance caching, fault-tolerant transactional systems, or scalable data distribution across clusters.
